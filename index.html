                Here's some of my own applications, and you can download them to
                have a try!<br>
                Tips: when you download and run a application file, Windows may
                stop you from running it. I'm sorry, but I have to pay $700 to
                get a Security Certificate and it is really very, very
                expensive! I can promise that the application won't hurt your
                computer.
